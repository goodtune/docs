Announcing Schedule, Preregistration & Party Details, and Hike Registration
=============================================================================

Write the Docs is less than a week away. I hope you all already have your tickets. They are almost all sold out, so if you haven't gotten yours yet, make sure to `do it soon`_.

Schedule is now live
--------------------

We have released the `final schedule`_ for the conference. We tried to group the talks into themes in between each break, and think it should flow nicely together. 

Pre-registration details
------------------------

`Urban Airship`_ will be graciously hosting our pre-registration event. They are located about 6 blocks from the venue, so it should be an easy place to get to. The event will last from 6-8ish, and that means you can get another hour of sleep in the morning.

The address is 334 NW 11th St, Portland, Or.

Party Details
-------------

We are doing something a bit different for the party at our conference. We're going to be renting out `Ground Kontrol`_, which is an arcade with a bar. It's a unique Portland venue, and should bring out your inner child. This will be a private event for the conference, so make sure to bring your badge. 

The capacity for Ground Kontrol is only 130 people, so we have another option as well. We're going to have a tab open at `Bailey's Taproom`_, a bar with 20 taps of great Northwest beer. This should give people a chance to either play some games, or check out Portland's great beer scene.

Both of these events happen on Monday, from 8-10 PM.

Hike Registration
-----------------

We have added a registration to the Hike, so that we have a head count for the event. We are capping the hike at 25 people, because more than that in the woods is a bit ridiculous. `Register now`_ for the hike, if you want to come explore the Portland woods with us.

The forecast for Sunday is looking particularly Portlandy (high of 55 and light rain), so make sure you bring rain gear!
